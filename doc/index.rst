Welcome to Tribler's documentation!
===================================

Tribler aims to give anonymous access to content. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography, and authentication the Internet norm.

For the past 20 years we have been building a very robust Peer-to-Peer system.
Today Tribler is robust: "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).
