********************
Tribler Experimental
********************

This is an experimental fork of `Tribler <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler>`_.
All features that are not expected to be mature enough for "normal" deployment in a single PR go here.

The motto of this repository is SPEED. If your test is slow, your code is bad.

Targets
=======

* To be as close to `Gumby <https://github.com/Tribler/gumby>`_ as possible.
* To not have tests and source code mixed in the same directory.
* To not have anything but source code and tests (including what is needed to run them on PRs).
* To allow collaborative development of source code.
* To use RST for all docstrings.

Whenever an experimental feature is deemed sufficiently mature, it can be merged into the "main" Tribler repository.
